## 🧠 Challenges & Learnings

1. **AutoSwapper SDK Limitation**

   * Tokens were initially swapped in the sender’s wallet instead of the receiver’s
   * Solved by swapping first, then approving the amount to the contract

2. **Pricing Complexity**

   * No single pricing API worketo enable live conversions
   * Combined **CoinMarketCap** for fiat and **Chainlink** for token price feeds

3. **Paymaster Quota Exhaustion**

   * Gasless transactions failed once credit ran out
   * Implemented fallback to **gas-sponsored a** model

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* AI-powered yield farming
* Cross-chain interoperability
* On-chain anti-fraud detection
